<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

For our Database Programming final assignment, we were assigned to create a database for a hypothetical business. In this case, we created Enchato.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
In January 2022, Enchanto was founded as a local Malaysian marketplace for unique and creative goods. It’s home to a plethora of masterpieces, unique handcrafted pieces, and art treasures ready to be owned by creative enthusiasts out there. It’s also home to pre-loved goods and vintage pieces of art. As mentioned, these items fall under a wide range of categories. In addition, a user may sign up either as a seller or for personal use. Despite such a great initiative, Enchanto stumbled across a problem that needed immediate attention to.
During its launch, Enchanto received an influx of traffic involving sellers and customers signing up for Enchanto’s personal and seller accounts on the website. Not having a proper data management system, Enchanto deployed a team of database programmers to handle and organize the company data into a single database. This report will showcase and project the different measures taken by the programming team in making Enchanto’s very own database a reality.
